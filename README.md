# twitter-sexism

The goal of this project is to identify sexist content from Twitter and determine where, geographically, this content is most likely to originate from.


## Source of training data

The list of sexist tweets used to train the machine learning model used in this package comes from Waseem, Zeerak  and  Hovy, Dirk, "Hateful Symbols or Hateful People? Predictive Features for Hate Speech Detection on Twitter," *Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop*, June 2016. (See https://github.com/ZeerakW/hatespeech.)
