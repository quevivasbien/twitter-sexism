3816,0,take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed & threatened.

3831,0,"That's about 4"", i think."
3832,0,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
3833,0,pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE
3834,0,"@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn yeah, i've got a cron to kick it. it must not be kicking it properly."
3835,0,"but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview."
3836,0,"@ctmf but if they do, i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department. i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that."

3847,0,"@informationchef i have no idea what these mean: requestContext, seriesList. guessing intervalstring would be 5m?"
3848,0,@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
3849,0,Disclaimer: None of these things I'm about to tell you are 100% accurate. Just *mostly* accurate. There are always exceptions.
3850,0,"@GregTheTerrible In web, yes. Clients other than web immediately delete tweets."
3851,0,@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn oh dear
3852,0,"phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse."

3857,0,@Arlen weird. i have an address on my account. not sure if i need to add that to my wishlist or not.
3858,0,@vex0rian @m1sp it's a nice update! i quite like it.
3859,0,"@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn no. something went awry, box ran out of memory. it's also a dev box."

3861,0,Can't wait until I get more data on this. But it looks like @spacekatgal should probably avoid her mentions at 8-10AM PDT Sundays. ;)
3862,0,"@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good."
3863,0,"Tweets which saw the most RTs tend to be questionable, abusive, and almost always aimed at @spacekatgal, @thequinnspiracy, @femfreq, and me."
3864,0,@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked.
3865,0,"@JimmyMcCunty @Spacekatgal oh, darn, you can't? shoot."
3866,0,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
3867,0,@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
3868,0,@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
3869,0,"In the past 12 hrs, GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot"

3871,0,"@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once, but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?!"
3872,0,"it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?"
3873,0,"@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch."
3874,0,"@sschinke @TsundereRager the latest version doesn't take this into account, iirc. i just added it to my custom bot blacklist."
3875,0,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
3876,0,"@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests, GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers"
3877,0,"@JimmyMcCunty @Spacekatgal well, find me some tweets where the hashtag is mentioned +us saying something that isn't questionable or abusive?"
3878,0,"add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
3879,0,@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
3880,0,"When we look at all mentions of a username, including RTs, @spacekatgal has received 1611 in the past 12h. @femfreq has received 911."

3884,0,"don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. <3"
3885,0,"@sschinke @TsundereRager Unclear. ToS prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first, iirc."
3886,0,@Faythemage @motavate i love those too much. TOO MUCH.
3887,0,@Sir5000 hm?
3888,0,"@informationchef hmm. using grafana, and it's giving me errors."
3889,0,@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
3890,0,it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
3891,0,literally #devops
3892,0,@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.
3893,0,@ctmf they are already setting up bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.
