3831,0,"That's about 4"", i think."
3832,0,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.

3858,0,@vex0rian @m1sp it's a nice update! i quite like it.

3862,0,"@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good."
3863,0,"Tweets which saw the most RTs tend to be questionable, abusive, and almost always aimed at @spacekatgal, @thequinnspiracy, @femfreq, and me."
3864,0,@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked.
3865,0,"@JimmyMcCunty @Spacekatgal oh, darn, you can't? shoot."
3866,0,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
3867,0,@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
3868,0,@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
3869,0,"In the past 12 hrs, GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot"
